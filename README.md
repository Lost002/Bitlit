# Bitlit
Bitlit is a simulation of the physical project I built. 
In the physical project, powered by a Rasberry Pi Pico, you would cover a sensor to toggle on/off an LED diode. There are 8 sensors, as well as 8 LED diodes. When you got to the point where there was a binary number 1-9, or an ACSII value representing A-Z, You will push a button and it will display that value on a display. Along with many more fetures!
This project, bitlit, is meant to simulate that physical build, you will have 8 'bits' and you can toggles them with 1 (on), 0 (off). to move left or right between bits use, <, or >. You will then type a corresponding character to check, and display that value.
